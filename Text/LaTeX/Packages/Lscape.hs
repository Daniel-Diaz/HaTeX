-- | This package option makes 'lscape' rotate the PDF paper – not
-- just the text on the page – when given the 'pdftex' option.
-- (Naturally, this works only with pdfLaTeX.) The result is that the
-- text is viewable online without the reader having to rotate his/her
-- head 90 degrees. The document still prints normally.

-- | All text within the 'landscape' environment is rotated through 90
-- degrees. The environment may span several pages. It works well
-- with, and was originally created for, use with 'longtable' to
-- produce long wide tables.
