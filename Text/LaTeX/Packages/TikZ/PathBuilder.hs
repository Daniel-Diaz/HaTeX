{-# LANGUAGE CPP #-}

-- | This module provides a monadic interface to build 'TPath' values.
--   It does so using 'PathBuilder's. The construction of a 'PathBuilder'
--   is equivalent to the construction of a 'TPath' by hand, but with
--   a sometimes more convenient syntax.
--
--   For example, this path corresponds to a triangle:
--
-- > trianglePath :: TPath
-- > trianglePath = bpath (pointAtXY (-1) 0) $ do
-- >    line $ pointAtXY 1 0
-- >    line $ pointAtXY 0 1
-- >    pcycle
--
--   The equivalent syntax created by hand would be:
--
-- > trianglePath :: TPath
-- > trianglePath = Cycle $ Start (pointAtXY (-1) 0) ->- pointAtXY 1 0 ->- pointAtXY 0 1
--
--   The 'Cycle' constructor at the beginning may seem unintuitive, since we are building
--   the path from left to right. In the 'PathBuilder' monad, the instructions are always
--   written in order.
